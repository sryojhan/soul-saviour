## 🎯 Goal

This game was created in under 48 hours for the [ComJamOn 2021 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/jamon2021), based on the theme **"birth"**.  
You play as a monk who was unjustly killed — refusing to perish, he now fights his way through the underworld seeking rebirth.

## ⚙️ How it Works

The game features procedurally generated maze-like levels filled with demonic enemies. The player must survive waves of enemies, collect the **seven Eternal Flames**, and confront a final boss to escape the underworld.

Core mechanics include:
- Melee and ranged combat
- Dash to evade and reposition
- Limited lives — once they're gone, death is final
- Health pickups and enemy types with varied behaviors
